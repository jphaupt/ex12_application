Exercises for a doctoral candidate position. 

Here are some things that I did _not_ do but may do later given the time. None of them are strictly necessary, but they are details that I would be interested in exploring nevertheless. 
- Part (b): check the HÃ¼ckel cyclic alkene formula (not familiar with this -- Look it up!). 
- Try to understand on physical ground where the coupling in $U_N$ comes from, since we start with a potential where all the $x$ are independent. I can show this mathematically (via operator splitting), but I do not understand why it shows up. 
- Part (d): maybe try to find a way to re-express the integral, or perhaps use a package like mpmath to go to further decimal places, so that we can reasonably go to higher N without getting overflow errors. 
- Where do the Ns go in the partition function calculations? I originally thought there would be an exponent ^N since we are taking N independent oscillators, but the calculation only works when I exclude this. I think maybe this is because of the split operator? i.e. the particles are not actually there, this is a way of splitting the operator $N$ times? 
- Show more work in parts (e) and (g). This is just busywork.
